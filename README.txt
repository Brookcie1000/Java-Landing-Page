Landing Page Example - James Brooks

--Installation--
This webpage works best when run on a server, but works perfectly fine run locally by opening the index.html file into a browser.

--Usage--
Open the index.html file using a browser. Using the navigation bar in the top right, click to show a menu of sections. Click the section you want to scroll to and it will highlight the button and section selected.
When scrolling, it will automatically adjust the active section to one in the main view.

More sections can be added to the html file as needed and the nav-bar will dynaically update itself for easy addition to the website.

I admit, the website isn't "pretty" but that wasn't my focus here - I simply wanted to show java scripting and dynamic updating.

--Development--
Made using VS Code with the help of gulp and browser-sync to allow faster debugging and dev.
